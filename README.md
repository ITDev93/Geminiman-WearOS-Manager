## Don't want to watch...?
No problem...

It's a Powerful ADB tool I have developed to make things easier for you to perform adb on your phone with your watch:
 1. Screenrecord...
 2. Debloat/Reinstall...
 3. Disable/Enable...
 4. Backup/Restore...
 5. Sideload Apps...
 6. Install Split Apk as APKS/ZIP...
 7. Pull Apks and Files...
 8. Run Shell Commands...
 9. Create Logs...

And it's all ad-free, no paywalls, and as simple as button press...
